## What this lesson covers

In the first lesson, you will get a chance to engage with the highest priority elements of the project Health Tracker. The goal of this lesson is to build familiarity. When you are done, you'll have a holistic sense for how the Health Tracker, as a tool, is really just the *reporting* stage of a *process*. 

Subsequent lessons will build your depth of knowledge regarding the practice of assessing software project management. When you are done with the first lesson, you'll be ready to begin applying the tracker with confidence, and tackle the material in the second lesson.
